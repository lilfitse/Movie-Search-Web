## 📽 About MovieMania

**MovieMania** is a sleek and dynamic website where you can:
- 🔎 **Search** for your favorite movies (no more endless scrolling through trash).
- ⭐ **Check Ratings** so you know if it’s a masterpiece... or a total dumpster fire.
- 🎥 **View Detailed Info** about the movies, including cast, release date, and a spicy overview.
- 🧠 **Decide smarter** what to watch next. No more “uhhh, idk” nights.

We built this because the world needs fewer arguments over "what to watch" and more time *watching*.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Because movies are a big deal. They teach us, they inspire us, and sometimes, they let us zone out after a long day of adulting.  
We respect that. You should too. ✊

Would you also like me to give you a *super minimal* or *super professional* version too, just in case you want a different vibe? 😎  
(And if you want, I can throw in a badge setup and social preview image tips too.) 🚀
